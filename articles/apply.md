# How to Apply the 12 Principles of EAO in Everyday Life?  

Each principle can be actively practiced through simple exercises and daily reflections. Here are ways to transform each one into something tangible and applicable:

## 1️⃣ You Are. Existence becomes real in the consciousness that perceives it.  
📌 **Practice:**  
✔ Every day, when you wake up, take 30 seconds to perceive yourself. Feel the presence of your consciousness and acknowledge that you exist.  
✔ Ask yourself: *If I were not here now, what would change?*  
🔥 **Objective:** Develop awareness of your own being.  

## 2️⃣ Only Here and Now Exist. The present is a constant flow between what was and what will be, simultaneously.  
📌 **Practice:**  
✔ Choose three moments in your day to pause and focus 100% on the present (during a meal, a shower, or before bed).  
✔ Ask yourself: *Where am I now? What am I feeling? What am I hearing?*  
🔥 **Objective:** Deconstruct anxiety about the future and the weight of the past.  

## 3️⃣ Everything Is Inside, Nothing Is Outside. What is perceived as external is a reflection of your consciousness.  
📌 **Practice:**  
✔ Whenever something external bothers you (a criticism, a problem, an obstacle), ask yourself: *What does this say about me?*  
✔ Try to observe if what you see in others is something that also exists within you.  
🔥 **Objective:** Develop self-awareness and responsibility for your reactions.  

## 4️⃣ You Are in Constant Transformation. Reality is shaped by each choice, and nothing remains the same.  
📌 **Practice:**  
✔ Write down a small decision you need to make today and reflect: *What different realities emerge from this choice?*  
✔ Understand that, even without realizing it, you are creating your future at every moment.  
🔥 **Objective:** Build awareness of the impact of your choices.  

## 5️⃣ Matter Is Condensed Energy. Energy structures consciousness, and consciousness directs energy.  
📌 **Practice:**  
✔ Choose an object and hold it in your hands. Ask yourself: *What was this before it existed? How did energy organize to create this?*  
✔ Meditate on how everything around you is just energy in different states.  
🔥 **Objective:** Expand perception of the nature of matter and energy.  

## 6️⃣ Above and Below Are Just a Matter of Perspective. Reality depends on the observer's point of view.  
📌 **Practice:**  
✔ Take a situation that bothered you recently and look at it from three different perspectives:  
- How you see it.  
- How a neutral person would see it.  
- How a distant observer would see it.  
🔥 **Objective:** Broaden your perception of reality and avoid limited judgments.  

## 7️⃣ Interaction Brings Reality to Life. Nothing exists in isolation. Everything manifests through the exchange between elements.  
📌 **Practice:**  
✔ Spend an entire day observing how everything in life is connected (relationships between people, technology, nature).  
✔ Notice how your actions generate reactions that extend far beyond what you imagine.  
🔥 **Objective:** Develop a systemic view of life.
