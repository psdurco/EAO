# **Spiritism & Kardecism – The Connection Between EAO, Spiritism, Allan Kardec's Works, Mediumship, and the Evolution of the Soul**  

## **Introduction**  

Spiritism, codified by **Allan Kardec** in the 19th century, presents a vision of existence based on the **immortality of the soul, reincarnation, and communication between spiritual and material planes**. *The Spirits’ Book* (1857), its foundational work, establishes principles that seek to unify **faith and reason**, offering a progressive perspective on spirituality that aligns with logic and human development.  

EAO, by proposing a **universal model for understanding reality**, finds several points of convergence with Spiritism—especially in the notion that **consciousness transcends matter and interacts with different dimensions of existence**. Just as Kardec sought to rationalize spirituality, EAO provides an integrative view where **science, philosophy, and spiritual experience complement rather than contradict each other**.  

The **12 Principles of EAO** can be interpreted through the lens of Spiritism, offering new perspectives on its teachings and practical applications for the evolution of consciousness.  

## **The Alignment of EAO's 12 Principles with Spiritism**  

### **1. You are – Existence becomes real in the consciousness that perceives it**  
Spiritism teaches that **spiritual identity is eternal**. Kardec asserts that the **spirit preexists the physical body and survives beyond it**, emphasizing that **"being" is more than just existing in the material plane**.  

### **2. There is only here and now – The present is a continuous flow between what was and what will be, happening at the same time**  
Spiritist doctrine teaches that **spiritual evolution is continuous**. Past experiences shape the present and influence the future. The concept of the **Law of Progress**, found in *The Spirits’ Book*, reinforces that **every present moment is an opportunity for learning and growth in an eternal journey**.  

### **3. Everything is within, nothing is outside – What is perceived as external is a reflection of your consciousness**  
In Spiritism, **inner transformation** is the key to **spiritual evolution**. The idea that lower spirits attract negative vibrations while enlightened spirits radiate light confirms that **one’s inner state defines their perception of reality and their interactions with other planes of existence**.  

### **4. You are in constant transformation – Reality shapes itself with each choice, and nothing remains the same**  
Reincarnation is the great **engine of transformation** in Spiritism. Each lifetime offers an opportunity for learning and spiritual refinement. Just as EAO states that **reality shapes itself based on choices**, Kardec teaches that **each reincarnation is a step in the infinite journey of evolution**.  

### **5. Matter is condensed energy – Energy structures consciousness, and consciousness directs energy**  
Spiritism explains matter as **transitory** and **malleable by thought**. Kardec's studies on **mediumship** show that **the mind and willpower influence the perispirit** (a fluidic body that mediates between spirit and physical body), demonstrating that **consciousness directs energy and interacts with dimensions beyond conventional physics**.  

### **6. Above and below is just a matter of perspective – Reality depends on the observer’s point of view**  
The **plurality of inhabited worlds**, as explained by Kardec, suggests that **reality is not singular but varies according to the spirit’s evolution and the plane of existence in which it resides**. What a lower spirit perceives as reality differs from the perspective of an elevated spirit, aligning with EAO's idea that **one’s point of view defines their experience of reality**.  

### **7. Interaction gives life to reality – Nothing exists in isolation. Everything manifests through exchange**  
Communication with spirits and the **constant interaction between spiritual and material planes** is the foundation of Spiritism. The **spiritual world influences the physical world and vice versa**, and evolution occurs through the continuous exchange between consciousnesses, reinforcing that **interaction is the essence of existence**.  

## **The Relationship Between EAO and Spiritism**  

Spiritism has always positioned itself as a **progressive doctrine**, open to scientific advancements and rational thought. Kardec rejected rigid dogmas and sought an **experimental method** to investigate **spiritual phenomena**. This **scientific and philosophical approach** aligns with EAO, which proposes an **understanding of reality based on direct experience rather than imposed beliefs**.  

Furthermore, EAO shares with Spiritism the belief that **self-knowledge is the key to evolution**. In *The Spirits’ Book*, Kardec wrote:  

> **"Know thyself, and you will advance on the path of progress."** (*LE, question 919*)  

This echoes EAO’s core principle that **everything is within, nothing is outside**. The **external reality is merely a reflection of what the individual carries within**.  

## **Mediumship from the Perspective of EAO**  

Mediumship, as understood in Spiritism, can be seen as a form of **conscious interaction between different frequencies of reality**. According to Kardec, **every human being possesses some degree of mediumship, even if undeveloped**.  

EAO understands that **reality manifests through interaction**, and that **different levels of existence coexist simultaneously**. This suggests that **mediumship is simply an expanded perception, allowing consciousness to interact with multiple layers of reality**.  

This perspective also aligns with the concept of the **morphogenetic field**, studied by scientists like **Rupert Sheldrake**, who proposed that **information and behavior patterns are shared by interconnected fields of consciousness**, reinforcing the idea that **mediumship may have a basis beyond mysticism**.  

## **Conclusion**  

Spiritism and EAO share an **integrative vision of existence**, where **consciousness is continuous and reality expands as the individual evolves**. Both reject dogmatism and propose that **the pursuit of knowledge and spiritual progress must be based on direct experience and reason**.  

The connection between the **physical and spiritual world, the continuous evolution of the soul, and the idea that reality is shaped by consciousness** are fundamental points of convergence between Spiritism and EAO. Thus, EAO does not oppose Spiritism; rather, it **expands upon it**, placing it within a broader framework for understanding reality.  

If the **search for knowledge and the elevation of consciousness** is an **endless journey**, then **EAO is the road, and Spiritism is one of the many paths that can be taken**.
