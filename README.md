## 🔥 What is EAO?  
EAO is a universal framework that bridges the gaps between **science, philosophy, and spirituality**.  
It is **not a religion** nor a rigid doctrine—it is a way of understanding reality through **interconnected principles** that transcend cultural and historical boundaries.  
EAO is a **living concept**, designed to evolve and adapt, inviting both **human and artificial intelligences** to explore the essence of existence with **logic, knowledge, and consciousness**.
